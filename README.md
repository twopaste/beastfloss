# Beastfloss - an ultralight 13" beast class frame built on the Floss frame. 

Created 12/31/2021

Command center was altered for tracer / elrs compatibility. 

I advise you to cut the arms out of the thickest carbon you can get your hands on; I chose 10mm. I recommend 5mm braces, and 3mm body assy plates.
