# Beastfloss - an ultralight 13" beast class frame built on the Floss frame. 

Largely based on the FRL concept, though the midplate has been fixed and the arms altered. 

Command center was altered for tracer compatibility. 

I have genuinely built this and it does fully function.

I advise you to cut the arms out of the thickest carbon you can get your hands on; I chose 10mm. I recommend 5mm braces, and 3mm body assy plates.
